# Spatial-Saturator

JUCE plug-in designed to widen the stereo image and enhance the bass of the incoming audio stream through applying processing to the mids and sides of the signal. 

Secondly a waveshaper saturator is applied to give it some more sonic "beef".

A digital limiter will also be introduced.
